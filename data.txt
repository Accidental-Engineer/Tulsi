Migraine without aura: 
  Feeling sick (nausea).
  Being sick (vomiting).
  Not liking bright lights or loud noises, so that you may just want to lie in a dark room.
Migraine with aura:
  Visual aura
      A temporary loss of part of vision.
      A bright, shimmering light, often in a C-shaped pattern, a bit like looking through an old-fashioned kaleidoscope, or zig-zag lines.
      Objects or letters on a page may seem to rotate, shake, or boil.
  Numbness and pins and needles are the second most common type of migraine aura. 
  Problems with speech are the third most common type of migraine aura.
  Other types of migraine aura include an odd smell, food cravings, a feeling of well-being, and other odd sensations.
Acute sinusitis
  In most people, acute sinusitis develops after a cold or flu-like illness.
  Pain and tenderness over the infected sinus. The pain is often throbbing and worse when you bend your head forward. Chewing may be painful.
  Nasal symptoms. You may have either:
    A blocked nose. Both sides of your nose usually feel blocked. Your sense of smell may also go for a while.
    A runny nose. If the discharge is greeny/yellow, it is more likely that you have a germ (bacterial) infection in your sinuses. The green/yellow colour is due to infected mucus and pus. A runny nose may dry up if the sinus drainage channels become blocked with thick mucus. If this happens, pain and tenderness over the infected sinus may become worse.
  A high temperature (fever). This may develop and you may feel generally unwell.
